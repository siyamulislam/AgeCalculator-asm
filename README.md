# AgeCalculator-asm
This calculator will calculate your age in years, months, and days -- as of any date of your choosing. 

For example,
	 The age of a person that has lived for 3 years and 11 months is 3 and the age will turn to 4 at his/her next birthday one month later. Most western countries use this age system.
